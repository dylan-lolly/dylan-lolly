Hello, GitHub! I am a full-stack Java developer with formal training from Tech Elevator.
My experience includes but is not limited to:<br/>
**software such as** Java, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, IntelliJ, VSCode,<br/>
**libraries and frameworks** like Sprint Boot and Vue.js,<br/>
**and techniques like** unit testing, integration testing, E/R design, table design, DAOs,
RESTful APIs, and JDBC.

While I have yet to secure gainful employment that utilizes what I've learned I am eager
to start developing some applications for myself and family to help make our lives a bit
easier and more organized. My first few applications will be based in what I know but I
am interested in branching out as well. The first language I want to learn next is Python.
